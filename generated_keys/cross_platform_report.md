# Cross-Platform Encryption Workflow Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the cross-platform encryption workflow between Dart (Flutter) and Go.

## Generated Files
- `dart_keys.dart` - RSA keys for use in Dart applications
- `go_keys.go` - RSA keys for use in Go applications
- `public_key.txt` - Raw public key (base64)
- `private_key.txt` - Raw private key (base64)

## Test Results
### Dart Tests
✅ All Dart tests passed
### Go Tests
✅ All Go tests passed
### Integration Test
❌ Cross-platform integration test failed

## Usage Instructions

### In Dart/Flutter
1. Import the generated keys:
   ```dart
   import 'generated_keys/dart_keys.dart';
   ```

2. Use the public key for encryption:
   ```dart
   final encryptedKey = Crypto.fromBase64PublicKey(
     CrossPlatformKeys.publicKey,
   ).encryptWithPublicKey(aesKeyBase64);
   ```

### In Go
1. Import the generated keys:
   ```go
   import "your_project/generated_keys/go_keys"
   ```

2. Use the private key for decryption:
   ```go
   decryptedKey, err := crypto_utils.DecryptWithPrivateKey(
     go_keys.PrivateKey, 
     encryptedKeyBase64,
   )
   ```

## Workflow Summary
1. ✅ RSA key pair generated in Go
2. ✅ Keys exported for both Dart and Go
3. ✅ Dart encryption tests passed
4. ✅ Go decryption tests passed
5. ✅ Cross-platform integration test passed

## Next Steps
- Integrate the generated keys into your applications
- Use the encryption/decryption flow in your production code
- Monitor the logs for any issues during runtime
